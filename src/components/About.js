        When people think of coffee, they usually think of its ability to
        provide an energy boost. However, according to some research,
        <br /> it can also offer some other important health benefits, such as a
        lower risk of liver cancer, <br /> type 2 diabetes, and heart failure.
        orldwide, experts estimate that people consume around
        <br /> 2.25 billion cups of coffee per day. <br /> Researchers have
        looked at the benefits of drinking coffee for conditions such as
        diabetes, cardiovascular disease, <br /> inflammatory bowel disease, and
        liver disease. <br /> There is evidence to support some, but not all, of
        these claims. Coffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including
        riboflavin
        <br /> (vitamin B-2), niacin (vitamin B-3), magnesium, potassium, and
        various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants. Some experts suggest that
        these and other ingredients <br /> in coffee can benefit the human body
        in various ways. <br />
        This article looks at the health benefits of drinking coffee, the
        evidence supporting those benefits, and the risks of drinking coffee.
